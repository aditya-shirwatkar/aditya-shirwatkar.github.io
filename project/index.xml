      <title>Representation Free Model Predictive Control for Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/rfmpc_cpp/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/rfmpc_cpp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Model Predictive Control is a popular and powerful control algorithm used in legged robot locomotion. In this project we show the application of the recently published walking controller, Representation Free Model Predictive Control (RF-MPC), to a quadruped robot, Stoch-3, in a simulation environment. The RF-MPC controller directly represents the rotational dynamics using the rotation matrix. Other walking controllers like Convex-MPC use Euler angles for representing orientations, which have singularity and approximation issues. RF-MPC models the quadruped robot as a single rigid body with massless legs. It uses a variation-based linearization scheme to linearize the model. The MPC control law is written in a standard Quadratic Program (QP) form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Algorithm can perform step-in-place motion for some duration after which the solution starts to diverge and the robot becomes unstable. The main reason behind this is the suboptimal reference trajectory of control inputs based on simple heuristics. Hence we generate the reference trajectory of control inputs for the RF-MPC by using the Convex MPC algorithm at a lower frequency. With this, we have been able to achieve robust performance for
all different types of gaits. The Convex MPC runs at 30 Hz and RF-MPC runs at 300 Hz. We demonstrate in-place stepping, forward walking, in-place turning, and sideways walking using the trot gait on the Stoch-3 robot in the Pybullet simulation environment. We also performed some preliminary hardware experiments for sim2real validation&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ViLocNav: Visual Learning-based Optimal Control and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/vilocnav/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Model-based control methods like MPC and iLQG are popular paradigms for autonomous robot navigation because they can efficiently plan robust robot motion trajectories by leveraging a known deterministic or stochastic dynamics model. However, using model-based methods in situations where the environment is a priori unknown and can only be observed partially through onboard sensors on the robot is challenging and requires mapping and localization of the robot w.r.t to the unknown environment.
Mapping can be used to estimate the 3D structure of the environment (using RGB / RGB-D images / LiDAR scans), which is used by a planner to compute paths to a goal. Although such purely geometric intermediate representations do not capture navigational affordances (such as: to go far away, one should step into a hallway, etc.). Furthermore, mapping is challenging with just RGB observations and often unreliable even with active depth sensors (such as in presence of shiny or thin objects or the presence of strong ambient light). End-to-end learning methods which do not rely on any model-based setting are used to sidestep this explicit map estimation step and have also been studied by some researchers. However, such approaches have proven to be extremely sample inefficient and highly specific to the system they were trained on. Plus the control outputs from the pipeline are jittery and often not optimal, which increases the difficulty of deployment in real-world scenarios.
In our project, we will try to improve on this shortcoming by combining deep learning and model-based control. Our pipeline will consist of a learning-based perception module along with optimal control for autonomous driving. A series of waypoints are produced by the learning-based perception module that guides the robot to the goal by avoiding obstacles. This approach is highly based on the paper “Combining Optimal Control and Learning for Visual Navigation in Novel Environments”. A model-based planner uses these waypoints to generate a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory, which is then executed on the physical system using feedback control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QHuMuS: Quadrupedal Humanoidal Multi-terrain Snake Robot</title>
      <link>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/qhumus/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For ground robotic systems, different trade-offs must be made when selecting movement modes such as serpentine, legged, and wheeled. The issues observed are that, a single mobility mode is not supportive or optimal and for all the terrain types like flat, sloped, staired, rough, muddy and cluttered. Another issue is that, different levels of autonomy is required depending on the environment condition. The current state of the art reconfiguable robots aim to solve this problem by transitioning between various mobility modes. Nevertheless, these rely on sophisticated mechanisms to disassemble and reassemble modules at different nodes, which increases the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, and also the motion planning complexity. In this work we propose QHuMuS: Quadrupedal Humanoidal Multi-terrain Snake Robot, that performs reconfiguration between the mobility modes of serpentine, wheeled quadruped, and humanoid without any re-arrangement. This work mainly addresses the design of such a reconfigurable robot, and the development of baseline gaits between all the possible configurations. Hence our proposed system has lesser SwaP requirements and motion planning complexity. Additionally simulation results are also provided that showcase the capabilities of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/trajopt_biped/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aditya-shirwatkar.github.io/project/trajopt_biped/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work presents a study on trajectory optimization for bipedal robots using the direct collocation method on a planar five-link underactuated system. The trajectories are generated using a non-linear program in Python with the aid of the CasADi toolbox. The main objective of the project is to implement optimal dynamic walking for human and ostrich gaits on various types of terrains such as sinusoidal, sloped, staired, and flat. The results of the study show that the proposed method is able to generate efficient and stable trajectories for bipedal robots, making it suitable for real-world applications. A comprehensive analysis of the generated trajectories and their performance on different terrains is also provided to understand the limitations and challenges of the method.&lt;/p&gt;
